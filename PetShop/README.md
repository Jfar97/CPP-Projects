**Pet Shop**

A C++ program demonstrating object-oriented design principles through a pet shop management system. The base class pet is used to define the derived classes cat and dog which have unique implementations of the pet class base methods.



Features:
- Base class pet with derived classes dog and cat demonstrating inheritance
- Polymorphic calculation of monthly fees
- Use of static members for consistent rate application

Running the Project:
1. Download the project files from github
2. Navigate to the project directory
3. Compile using desired C++ compiler such as g++
4. Run the compiled program

Future Improvements:
- Implement base and derived classes as header files and .cpp files that define the header bodies
- Expand the variety of pet types and services
- Add a user interface for interactive management
