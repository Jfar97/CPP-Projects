**Rock Paper Scissors**
A C++ program that implements the classic game of rock, paper, or scissors. The game gets an input from the player to choose their move and compares it to a randomly generated move by the computer.

Features:
- User input validation to ensure invalid inputs are handled properly
- Random computer generation

Running the Project:
1. Download the project files from GitHub
2. Navigate to the project directory
3. Compile using desired C++ compiler such as g++
4. Run the compiled program

Future Improvments:
- Implement a player class to streamline and enhance functionality of the game
- Add a leader board system to track players
- Add data persistence using file I/O
