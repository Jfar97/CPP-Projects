# C++ Projects

A collection of C++ projects demonstrating various fundamental programming concepts:

1. PetShop: An object-oriented program showcasing inheritance and polymorphism in a pet shop management system.

2. GuessingGame: A number guessing game featuring file I/O for leaderboard persistence and input validation.

3. RockPaperScissors: Classic game implementation demonstrating random number generation and robust input handling.

4. TwentyQuestions: A binary search tree-based guessing game, highlighting advanced data structure implementation.

5. Life: Conway's Game of Life simulation, showcasing 2D vector manipulation and cellular automata principles.

6. Battleship: A console-based Battleship game featuring AI opponent and complex game state management.

These projects represent my journey in learning C++, exploring various programming concepts and applying them to create functional applications.
