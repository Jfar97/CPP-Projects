**Life**

A C++ project that implements Conway's game of life. Ten generations are cycled through after a valid set of starting board positions are given.

Features:
- The board is represented as a 2D vector
- Board size can be changed by adjusting the single macro controlling board size
- Robust input validation to ensure only valid board positions seperated by commas is accepted
- Timing delays between generations to better visualize generational changes

Running the Project:
1. Download the project files from GitHub
2. Navigate to the project directory
3. Compile using desired C++ compiler such as g++
4. Run the compiled program

Future Improvements:
- Implement a board class and player class to better encapsulate data and enhance program functionality and features
- Implement an option to choose from preset starting patters at generation 0
