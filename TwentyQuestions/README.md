**Twenty Questions**

A C++ project that implements a twenty questions fruit and vegetable guessing game using a binary search tree. The tree is traversed based upon user input.

Features:
- Custom binary search tree structure implemented for the game
- Node-based navigation and game logic
- User input validation

Running the Project:
1. Download the project files from GitHub
2. Navigate to the project directory
3. Compile using desired C++ compiler such as g++
4. Run the compiled program

Future Improvements:
- Move class declaration to a header file and define the class in a seperate .cpp definition file
- Add data persistence for player guesses using file I/O
